# AI Assistant Chat Application

This project is an innovative AI-powered chat application built with Next.js and Material-UI. It features a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. The application includes:

- A welcoming landing page with a call-to-action to start chatting
- An intelligent chat interface powered by OpenAI's API
- Dynamic message formatting for improved readability
- Light and dark mode toggle for user preference
- Smooth transitions and animations for an engaging user experience

The app demonstrates modern web development practices, including server-side rendering, client-side routing, and responsive design. It's an excellent example of how to create an interactive AI chat application using cutting-edge web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14 for server-side rendering and routing
- React for building the user interface
- Material-UI (MUI) for responsive design components
- OpenAI API for powering the AI chat functionality
- Vercel Analytics for tracking application usage
- CSS-in-JS styling with MUI's styling solution
- Custom animations using keyframes
- Next.js App Router for advanced routing capabilities
- React Hooks for state management and side effects

This comprehensive tech stack showcases a modern, efficient approach to building a sophisticated AI chat application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
